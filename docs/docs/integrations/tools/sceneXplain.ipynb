The girl on the left, Satsuki, is dressed in a yellow cardigan, a yellow skirt, yellow socks, and is holding a red umbrella. Mei, on the right side, is wearing a white shirt paired with a brown skirt and also holds a red umbrella. Standing between them under a large black umbrella is Totoro, a large grey figure with big round eyes, wearing a green top. They are situated at a bus stop, surrounded by lush green foliage, creating a warm and protective atmosphere in the rain. The presence of the bus stop sign reinforces the setting. The girls are looking up at Totoro, reflecting a mood of wonder and excitement.'"
